# database-design
In this project, I designed a relational database system for a coffee shop based in New York. Before the project, their data resided in various places, ranging from accounting software, POS systems, supplier's database, spreadsheets.
I had to design one central database to house all of these data. The following steps were carried out in the process:
Identify entities, identify attributes, create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using the pgAdmin ERD tool, normalise the tables, define keys and relationships, create database objects by generating and running the SQL script generated by the ERD tool.
Also, I created a view and a materialized view and exported the data to CSV files which were later imported into MySQL database.
Tools used for this project were PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL.
